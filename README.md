# MobileAutomationFramework
# Selenium Appium Framework using Java

This repository contains a framework for mobile automation testing using Selenium and Appium with Java. It provides a structured approach to writing test scripts and organizing test cases for mobile applications.

## Features

- Uses Selenium WebDriver for automating web interactions.
- Utilizes Appium for automating mobile interactions.
- Written in Java, a widely used programming language for automation testing.
- Supports parallel execution of test cases.
- Provides a modular structure for easy test case management.
- Generates detailed test reports with test results.
- Supports Android and iOS platforms.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Android SDK (for Android testing)
- Xcode (for iOS testing)
- Appium Server

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using Maven or your preferred build tool.
3. Update the configuration files in the `src/test/resources` directory with your desired settings.
4. Write your test scripts using the provided framework structure in the `src/test/java` directory.
5. Run the test scripts using your preferred test runner or IDE.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a standard Maven project structure for Java projects:

- `src/test/java`: Contains the test script files organized in packages.
- `src/test/resources`: Contains the configuration files, test data, and other resources.
- `src/main/java`: Contains the utility classes and helper methods used by the test scripts.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains additional resources used by the framework.

## Writing Test Scripts

1. Create a new package in the `src/test/java` directory for your test scripts.
2. Create a new test script file in the package and write your test logic using the framework methods.
3. Use the provided utility classes and helper methods to interact with the application under test.
4. Organize your test scripts into meaningful test suites or groups.

## Running Tests

You can run the tests using your preferred test runner or IDE. Alternatively, you can use Maven to run the tests from the command line:

```
mvn test
```

The framework supports parallel execution of test cases for faster test execution. You can configure the level of parallelism in the configuration files.

## Test Reports

The framework generates detailed test reports in HTML format. After running the tests, you can find the reports in the `target/surefire-reports` directory. Open the HTML file in a browser to view the test results.
